## Interactive run-time dart code generator app for flutter widgets.

Flutter Studio is an open source interactive Dart code generator developed in Flutter, the hybrid mobile programming framework based on the Dart language, made by Google.

Initially developed as an official submission for the first ever Flutter International Hackathon, this project aims to help make flutter as fast and easy to learn as possible for beginners as well as seasoned developers.

As popularity of flutter keeps on increasing with each new release, and more people are interested to try their hands with this new framework each day. We hope this project can serve as a starting point to all those who are looking to try out flutter, and in due course of time, can evolve into something much more.

The interactive UI offers a range of widgets to choose from which can be viewed on the canvas board. As the user adds new widgets to the canvas, the corresponding Dart code for the widget tree is seamlessly generated at run time in code preview window.

This code can be - 
- Saved to local device storage as a `.dart` file
- Copied to the clipboard
- Shared via a range of third party apps

A short demo walkthrough of the app can be found here on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/E7GrLKWOVIY).

## Note
We accidentally broke the master branch code! We promise we're working on a fix for it. Meanwhile, please use the [preview](https://github.com/siddharthpatankar/flutterstudio/tree/preview) branch for the lastest stable working code.

Also, the preview branch version of this app was only prepared for a demo within a short span of 5 hours, and hence for now, only the following basic material widgets are supported -
1. Default `Scaffold`
2. Default `AppBar`
3. `Center` widget
4. `Text` widget with pre-defined text
5. Deafult `FloatingActionButton`

> **Over time, support for more widgets will be added to the app. Any contributions, ideas, comments or suggestions are always welcome!**

Feel free to fork the project and try out your hands with flutter development! Let's build something great together!
